# 🏥 HealthSure – Medical Insurance Claim Predictor (In Progress)

HealthSure is a machine learning project that aims to predict **medical insurance claim amounts** based on key health and lifestyle factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  
The goal is to build a complete end-to-end ML pipeline — from data analysis to deployment as an interactive web application.

This project is currently under development and will be updated as each stage is completed.

## 🚧 Current Project Status: Building Phase

### ✅ Data Exploration & Understanding (Completed)
- Loaded insurance dataset using **Pandas**
- Checked for missing values and duplicates
- Analyzed data distribution (histograms, bar plots, box plots)
- Generated a **correlation heatmap** to identify key relationships
- Created categorical features such as:
  - Age groups
  - BMI categories
  - Smoker/Non-smoker encoding

### 🔄 Model Development (In Progress)
- Preparing data for training using:
  - Label Encoding
  - Feature Scaling
  - Train-test split
- Training multiple Regressors:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest Regressor
  - Support Vector Regressor (SVR)
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Evaluating models using:
  - **R² Score**
  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**

### 📝 Upcoming Work
- Hyperparameter tuning using **GridSearchCV**
- Exporting final model, scaler, and encoders using **Joblib**
- Building a **Streamlit** web application
- Integrating the deployed model for real-time prediction
- UI improvements & result visualization

## 🧠 Project Objective

The purpose of HealthSure is to:

1. Understand how various health factors influence medical expenses  
2. Build a predictive model that estimates insurance claim amounts  
3. Deploy the model as a simple and user-friendly web app  

This aligns with real-world applications where insurance companies use ML to estimate risk and pricing.
